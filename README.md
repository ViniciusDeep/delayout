# Delayout
An(other 🤷🏻‍♂️) AutoLayout DSL to make constraints more quickly and with less verbosity.

This is a project with the objective to learn more about iOS AutoLayout and make a tool in order to facilitate making constraints using a Domain Specifc Language (DSL).

It's based on Swift by Sundell article https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/building-dsls-in-swift. Feedbacks and suggestions are welcome.
